While refactoring the original script, 
I focused on following both PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines to improve overall readbility and clarity.
The script originally included two functions; do_math_stuff() and do_string_stuff(),
which were renamed to transform_numbers() and transform_strings() to convey their purposes better.
Variables such as list1, list2, and x were replaced with more descriptive names 
like numbers, fruit, and transformed_list.
These alterations made the revised script much easier to understand at a quick glance.


Docstrings were added to each function to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
Inline comments were added as well, to further clarify the intent of specific blocks of code.
The addition of these two things greatly improve readability and follow PEP 257 standards.


I also refactored the original for loops and replaced them with list comprehensions,
as well as replacing the manual string concatenation with " ".join().
These changes improve the code's efficiency and functionality while maintaining the readability.
