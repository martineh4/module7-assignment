## Project Overview
This is a practice exercise on refactoring existing Python scripts to be more efficient and meet standard conventions.

## Original Code
Applied transformations to:
- A list of strings
- A list of numbers

Contained vague variable names and inefficient loops


## Refactored Improvements
- Descriptive function and variable names
- Added docstrings and inline comments
- Replaced 'for' loops with list comprehensions
- Simplified concatenation using .join()
- Structure follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Ensure Python is installed on your device
3. Run the script from a terminal of your choice
